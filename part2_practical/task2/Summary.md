Testim.io's AI-powered testing significantly improves test coverage 
compared to manual testing. The AI uses smart element recognition 
that adapts when page layouts change, reducing test maintenance. 
Traditional manual testing requires a human tester to repeatedly 
log in with different credentials, which is time-consuming and 
prone to human error. Automated testing with AI can execute hundreds 
of test scenarios in minutes, running 24/7 without fatigue. The 
AI's self-healing capability means tests continue working even when 
developers modify the UI, whereas manual test scripts would break.
